# California Housing Price Prediction üè†

This project uses the California Housing dataset to analyze and predict median house values through various regression models, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and locally weighted linear regression (LWLR). The analysis evaluates model performance using metrics like R¬≤, MAE, and RMSE.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualized pairwise relationships, correlation heatmaps, and histograms to uncover key predictors.  
  - Identified **median income** as the strongest predictor for house prices.

- **Linear Regression Models:**  
  - **Simple Linear Regression:** Focused on median income as a single predictor, achieving an R¬≤ score of **0.459**.  
  - **Multiple Linear Regression:** Leveraged multiple features to improve performance, achieving an R¬≤ score of **0.576**.

- **Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR):**  
  - Tuned the `tau` parameter to optimize predictions, achieving an R¬≤ score of **0.473** on test data.

## Dataset

- **Source:** California Housing Dataset  
- **Size:** 20,640 records  
- **Features:**  
  - Median Income  
  - House Age  
  - Average Rooms  
  - Average Bedrooms  
  - Population  
  - Average Occupancy  
  - Latitude and Longitude  
  - Median House Value  

## Results

- **Simple Linear Regression:**  
  - MAE: **0.630**, RMSE: **0.842**, R¬≤: **0.459**  
- **Multiple Linear Regression:**  
  - MAE: **0.533**, RMSE: **0.746**, R¬≤: **0.576**  
- **LWLR:**  
  - MAE: **0.553**, RMSE: **0.797**, R¬≤: **0.473**  

## Key Insights

- Median income is the most significant predictor of housing prices.  
- Multiple linear regression outperformed simple linear regression and LWLR in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.  
- LWLR offers flexibility in capturing non-linear relationships but is computationally intensive.
